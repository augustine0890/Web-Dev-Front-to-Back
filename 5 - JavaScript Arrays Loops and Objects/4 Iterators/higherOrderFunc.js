/*
REVIEW
- Abstraction allows us to write complicated code in a way thatâ€™s easy to reuse, debug, and understand for human readers

- We can work with functions the same way we would any other type of data including reassigning them to new variables

- JavaScript functions are first-class objects, so they have properties and methods like any object

- Functions can be passed into other functions as parameters

- A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both
