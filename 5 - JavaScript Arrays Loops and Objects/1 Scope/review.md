## Review: Scope
Letâ€™s review the following terms:

- <strong>Scope</strong> is the idea in programming that some variables are accessible/inaccessible from other parts of the program.
- <strong>Blocks</strong> are statements that exist within curly braces `{}`.
- <strong>Global scope</strong> refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.
- <strong>Global variables</strong> are variables that exist within global scope.
- <strong>Block scope</strong> refers to the context within which variables that are accessible only within the block they are defined.
- <strong>Local variables</strong> are variables that exist within block scope.
- <strong>Global namespace</strong> is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
- <strong>Scope pollution</strong> is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.
